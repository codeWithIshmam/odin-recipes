        <h1>Chicken Tandoori</h1>
        <img src="../images/chicken-tandoori.jpg" alt="a beautiful picture of finished dish of tandoori chicken"/>
        <p>Tandoori chicken gets its name from the bell-shaped tandoor clay oven which is also used to make naan, or Indian flatbread.</p>
        <p>Skinless legs and thighs are marinated in a tenderizing mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, and spices and the meat is slashed to the bone in several places helping the marinade penetrate and the chicken cook more quickly.The key to tandoori chicken is to use bone-in thighs and legs (yay! our favorite cuts) because they have enough fat to stay moist under the heat of the grill. We don't recommend this dish with chicken breasts, they'll dry out too easily.</p>
