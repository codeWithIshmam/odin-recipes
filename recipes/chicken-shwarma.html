        <p>What does Shawarma mean?Shawarma refers to a meat-cooking technique which is popular in Middle Eastern street food. Thin slices of spiced meat and fat (most commonly lamb) are stacked together on a vertical spit and cooked by slowly rotating that spit in front of a fire or another heat source. The result is tender, juicy meat that can be shaved off a bit at a time to serve..</p>
        <p>While the traditional version involves live fire and a vertical spit, we’ve simplified the process by marinating the chicken and then roasting it in the oven. Since the cooking method is different, our version varies greatly from traditional shawarma, but it mimics the original in both flavor and tenderness– and it’s easier to make at home!</p>
