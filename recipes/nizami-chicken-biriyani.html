            <li>In a wok, deep-fry the onions, remove them from the oil and set them aside.
            </li>
            <li>Add half of these onions to the marinated chicken. Add curd, ghee and some of the oil used for deep-frying.
            </li>
            <li>In a cooker, add water, cinnamon, cardamom, peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, ginger-garlic paste and ghee. Season it with salt. Bring this to a boil.
